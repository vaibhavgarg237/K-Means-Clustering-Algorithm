# K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm
We are given a data set of items, with certain features, and values for these features (like a vector). The task is to categorize those items into groups. To achieve this, we will use the kMeans clustering algorithm; an unsupervised learning algorithm.

In this particular code , I have implemented k mean clustering algorithm in MATLAB , without using built-in function
